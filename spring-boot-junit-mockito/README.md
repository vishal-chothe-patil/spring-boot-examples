# Spring-boot-junit-mockito Example üìò

This project demonstrates how to write unit tests in a Spring Boot application using `JUnit 5` and `Mockito`. It includes examples for testing service and controller layers with proper mocking and verification.

## Project Overview ‚úÖ 

Key goals of this Example:
- Understand the role of JUnit and Mockito in unit testing
- How to write effective tests for Spring Boot services and controllers
- Practice mocking repository methods and verifying interactions
- Improve confidence and maintainability of your backend code

## What is JUnit?

**JUnit** is a unit testing framework for Java applications. It helps test individual components (like methods in a class) to ensure they behave as expected.

- Used to write repeatable and automated test cases
- Helps catch bugs early during development
- Integrates easily with build tools (Maven/Gradle) and CI/CD

---

## What is Mockito?

**Mockito** is a popular Java mocking framework used with JUnit.

- It creates fake (mock) objects to isolate the code being tested
- Helps simulate behaviors of dependencies like repositories, services, etc.
- Allows you to **focus on testing logic**, not the actual implementation of dependencies

---

## üîç Why Use JUnit + Mockito in Spring Boot?

- To **test components in isolation**
- To **verify interactions** between service, repository, and controller layers
- To ensure application stability through unit tests before deployment
- To **mock dependencies** instead of connecting to real databases or APIs
